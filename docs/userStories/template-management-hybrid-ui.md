# ðŸŽ¨ User Story: Hybrid Template Management UI (Dropdown + Modal)

## Overview
As a user, I want to quickly switch between my intro templates from the Now Playing page, and also have an elegant, accessible way to create, edit, delete, and preview templatesâ€”all without leaving the context of the player. The experience should be minimal, mobile-first, and provide helpful guidance for new and advanced users alike.

**Note:** The standalone @templates route and its components have been removed. All template management is now handled inline or via modal in the Now Playing page for a more streamlined, contextual experience.

## User Journey
1. User opens the Now Playing page and sees the template selector dropdown.
2. User can quickly switch templates from the dropdown for instant intro changes.
3. User clicks a "+" or "Manage" button in the dropdown to open the template management modal.
4. In the modal, user can:
   - View all templates (list or cards)
   - Create a new template (with name, prompt, and helpful placeholders/examples)
   - Edit or delete existing templates
   - Preview a template's effect (optional)
   - Get inline help and guidance
5. User saves changes and returns to the Now Playing page, with the new/updated template available for selection.
6. All actions are accessible by keyboard and screen reader, and the UI is optimized for mobile and desktop.

## Technical Implementation
- Add a "+" or "Manage" button to the template selector dropdown.
- Implement a modal dialog for template management:
  - List all templates with edit/delete actions
  - Form for creating/editing templates (name, prompt, placeholders, help)
  - Optionally, preview the effect of a template
  - Use focus trap, ARIA roles, and return focus on close
  - Large tap targets and swipe-to-close on mobile
- Ensure all actions are accessible and keyboard-navigable
- Provide clear feedback for save, edit, and delete actions
- Use minimal, modern design with clear separation from the player
