## ðŸŽµ User Story: Seamless Integration of Spotify Authentication with Firebase Services

### Overview

As a user, I want to log into the application using my Spotify account. Upon successful authentication, I should have seamless access to various features powered by Firebase services, such as data storage, content management, and AI-driven functionalities.

### User Journey

1. **Authentication Initiation**:
   The user navigates to the application and opts to sign in using their Spotify credentials.

2. **Authorization Process**:
   The user is redirected to Spotify's authorization page to grant the application necessary permissions.

3. **Access Granted**:
   Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected back to the application, now recognized as a logged-in user.

4. **Personalized Experience**:
   The user can now access personalized content and features within the application.

5. **Data Interaction**:
   The user can interact with various features that involve storing and retrieving data, such as saving preferences or uploading content.

6. **AI-Powered Features**:
   The user can utilize AI-driven functionalities, enhancing their experience within the application.

### Technical Architecture Overview

- **Authentication**: Use Auth.js (NextAuth.js) with the Spotify provider to handle OAuth2 login and manage user sessions with JWTs.

- **Session Strategy**: Stateless session management via JWTs, including the Spotify access token and refresh token for authorized API access.

- **Server-Side Token Management**: Refresh Spotify tokens server-side before expiry and re-embed in the session JWT as needed.

- **Firebase Access**: Use Firebase Admin SDK on the backend to create a Firebase Custom Token after successful login.

- **Client-Side Firebase Auth**: The custom token is sent to the client where Firebase's SDK signs in the user using `signInWithCustomToken`, enabling access to Firestore, Storage, and Genkit.

- **Access Control**: Firestore and Storage rules are written per user, based on their UID from Firebase Auth, ensuring user-level data segregation.

- **Data Flow**: User signs in via Spotify â†’ NextAuth session created â†’ Firebase Custom Token generated â†’ Client signs in to Firebase â†’ Access granted to Firebase services.

- **Compliance & Security**: All access is scoped per user. Sensitive tokens are not exposed to the client. Firebase and Spotify sessions are managed independently but linked logically through a verified identity.

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Spotify Authentication**:
  Users can authenticate using their Spotify accounts without any technical hindrances.

- **Session Management**:
  User sessions are managed efficiently, ensuring a seamless experience across different sessions.

- **Access to Features**:
  Authenticated users have access to all features that require user identification, including data storage and AI functionalities.

- **Security Compliance**:
  All user data interactions comply with security standards, ensuring data privacy and integrity.

- **Error Handling**:
  The application gracefully handles any errors during authentication or data interactions, providing clear feedback to the user.
