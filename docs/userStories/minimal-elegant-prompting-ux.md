## Overview

As a user, I want to generate and personalize AI intros for the currently playing track with minimal effort, using a beautiful, mobile-first interface that makes it easy to switch, create, edit, and delete prompt templates, and to control the style of intros without being overwhelmed.

## User Journey

1. User opens Now Playing and sees a "Generate Intro" button or auto-generated intro.
2. User can quickly switch templates from a dropdown/segmented control.
3. User can tap "Manage Templates" to open a modal for CRUD actions.
4. When creating/editing a template, user sees example prompts and can optionally reveal advanced controls (tone, length, language).
5. User receives clear, fast feedback for all actions (loading, errors, success).
6. All flows are mobile-first, accessible, and visually elegant.
