# Authentication Integration Changes

> **Workflow Note**: This implementation will follow a sequential approach:
>
> 1. We will focus on one task at a time
> 2. Each task requires your approval before moving to the next
> 3. After each approved task, I will show the remaining tasks
> 4. This ensures careful implementation and proper review at each step
> 5. Update each subtask when done
