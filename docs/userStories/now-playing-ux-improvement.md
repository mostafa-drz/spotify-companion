# ðŸŽµ User Story: Now Playing UI/UX Improvement

## Overview
As a user, I want the Now Playing page to be visually appealing, easy to use, and consistent with the rest of the app, so that I can enjoy a seamless and delightful experience while listening to music and exploring AI-generated intros.

This user story builds on the template selection feature described in [integrate-selected-template-with-intro.md](./integrate-selected-template-with-intro.md), focusing on elevating the overall user experience.

## User Journey
1. User opens the Now Playing page
2. User sees a clean, well-organized layout with clear sections
3. User can easily identify the current track, template, and intro
4. User interacts with controls (playback, regenerate, template selection) with clear feedback
5. User enjoys a responsive and accessible interface on all devices

## Goals
- Improve visual hierarchy and spacing
- Enhance typography and readability
- Ensure color and contrast accessibility
- Achieve component and interaction consistency
- Modernize controls and selectors
- Provide clear feedback and status indicators
- Ensure responsiveness and accessibility
- Add microinteractions for delight

## Technical Implementation
- Refactor layout for better spacing and section separation
- Use consistent typography and font sizes for headings, track info, and intro
- Apply a custom-styled dropdown for template selection (reuse or extend TemplateSelector)
- Style the "Enable AI Intros" toggle as a modern switch
- Use consistent button styles and icon buttons for audio controls
- Add loading indicators and toasts for actions (e.g., saving, regenerating)
- Ensure all elements are keyboard accessible and have ARIA labels
- Add subtle hover/focus/transition effects
- Test and optimize for mobile and tablet
