# ðŸŽµ User Story: Template Selection in Now Playing

## Overview

As a user, I want to select and apply different intro templates while listening to music, so that I can get varied perspectives and information about each track. I want to be able to switch templates on the fly and have them immediately applied to the current track's intro.

## User Journey

1. User opens the Now Playing page
2. User sees the currently playing track and its intro
3. User can select a different template from a dropdown
4. User can regenerate the intro using the selected template

6. User can quickly switch between templates without leaving the Now Playing page
